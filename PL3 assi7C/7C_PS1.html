            <dt>Highly Portable</dt>
            <dd>
                Suppose you are running Python on Windows and you need to shift the same to either a 
                Mac or a Linux system, then you can easily achieve the same in Python without having 
                to worry about changing the code. This is not possible in other programming languages,
                thus making Python one of the most portable languages available in the industry.</dd>
            <dt>High-Level Language</dt>
            <dd>
                Python has been designed to be a high-level programming language, which means that when
                 you code in Python you donâ€™t need to be aware of the coding structure, architecture as
                  well as memory management </dd>
            <dt>GUI</dt>
            <dd>A graphical user interface (GUI) allows a user to interact with a computer program using a 
                pointing device that manipulates small pictures on a computer screen. </dd>

            
            <dt>Object-Oriented Approach</dt>
            <dd>Object-Oriented Approach
                One of the key aspects of Python is its object-oriented approach. This basically means 
                that Python recognizes the concept of class and object encapsulation thus allowing programs
                 to be efficient in the long run.</dd>
