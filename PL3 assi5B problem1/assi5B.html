                <section>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Android is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source software,
                         designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Android is developed by a consortium
                          of developers known as the Open Handset Alliance and commercially sponsored by Google. It was unveiled in November 2007,
                           with the first commercial Android device launched in September 2008.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 22px;">1. Interface</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 18px;">Android's default user interface is mainly based on direct manipulation, using touch inputs that loosely correspond to real-world actions, 
                        like swiping, tapping, pinching, and reverse pinching to manipulate on-screen objects, along with a virtual keyboard.[79] Game controllers 
                        and full-size physical keyboards are supported via Bluetooth or USB.[80][81] The response to user input is designed to be immediate and provides
                         a fluid touch interface, often using the vibration capabilities of the device to provide haptic feedback to the user. Internal hardware, such 
                         as accelerometers, gyroscopes and proximity sensors are used by some applications to respond to additional user actions, for example adjusting 
                         the screen from portrait to landscape depending on how the device is oriented,[82] or allowing the user to steer a vehicle in a racing game by
                          rotating the device, simulating control of a steering wheel.[83]

                    <p style="font-size: 22px;">2. Applications</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 18px;">Applications ("apps"), which extend the functionality of devices (and must be 64-bit[91]), are written using the Android software development kit 
                        (SDK)[92] and, often, Kotlin programming language, which replaced Java as Google's preferred language for Android app development in May 2019,[93] 
                        and was originally announced in May 2017.[94][95] Java is still supported (originally the only option for user-space programs, and is often mixed 
                        with Kotlin), as is C++.[96] Java and/or other JVM languages, such as Kotlin, may be combined with C/C++,[97] together with a choice of non-default 
                        runtimes that allow better C++ support.[98] The Go programming language is also supported, although with a limited set of application programming interfaces (API).[99]

                    <p style="font-size: 22px;">3. Memory management</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 18px;">Since Android devices are usually battery-powered, Android is designed to manage processes to keep power consumption at a minimum. When an application
                         is not in use the system suspends its operation so that, while available for immediate use rather than closed, it does not use battery power or CPU
                          resources.[113][114] Android manages the applications stored in memory automatically: when memory is low, the system will begin invisibly and automatically
                           closing inactive processes, starting with those that have been inactive for the longest amount of time.[115][116] Lifehacker reported in 2011 that 
                           third-party task killer applications were doing more harm than good.[117]
