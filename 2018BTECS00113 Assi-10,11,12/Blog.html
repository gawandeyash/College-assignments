        <h1 style="text-align: center;">JavaScript</h1>
        <p>JavaScriptÂ® (often shortened to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented
             language with first-class functions, and is best known as the scripting language 
             for Web pages, but it's used in many non-browser environments as well. It is a 
             prototype-based, multi-paradigm scripting language that is dynamic, and supports 
             object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.

            JavaScript runs on the client side of the web, which can be used to design / program
             how the web pages behave on the occurrence of an event. JavaScript is an easy to 
                learn and also powerful scripting language, widely used for controlling web page behavior.</p>

        <h1 style="text-align: center;">React</h1>
        <p>React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is an open-source, front end, JavaScript library[3] for 
            building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual
             developers and companies.[4][5][6] React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or
              mobile applications. However, React is only concerned with rendering data to the DOM, and so creating
               React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for state management and routing.[7][8] 
               Redux[9] and React Router[10] are respective examples of such libraries.</p>
